The chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a type of domesticated fowl, a subspecies of the red
junglefowl. It is one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a population of
more than 19 billion as of 2011.[1] Humans keep chickens primarily as a source of food, consuming
both their meat and their eggs.
