The turkey is a large bird in the genus Meleagris, which is native to the Americas. One species,
Meleagris gallopavo (commonly known as the domestic turkey or wild turkey), is native to the
forests of North America, from northern Mexico, throughout the midwest and eastern United States,
and into southeastern Canada. The other living species is Meleagris ocellata or the ocellated
turkey, native to the forests of the Yucat√°n Peninsula.[1] Males of both turkey species have a
distinctive fleshy wattle or protuberance that hangs from the top of the beak (called a snood).
They are among the largest birds in their ranges. As in many galliformes, the male is larger and
 much more colorful than the female.
